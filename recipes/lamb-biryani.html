            <li>3 tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>4 green chile peppers, halved lengthwise</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground red pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>7 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon saffron</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons warm milk</li>  
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place basmati rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 30 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks and cook in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add onions; cook and stir until onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic paste and ginger paste into onion mixture; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Sprinkle cilantro and mint over onion mixture and cook 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Add lamb chops to the skillet; season with salt. Cook lamb until chops are browned on both sides, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomatoes, green chile peppers, and ground red pepper; continue cooking until oil begins to separate from the sauce, about 10 minutes. Add yogurt and lemon juice; cover and cook until the lamb is tender, about 15 minutes. Add some water as needed to keep mixture from getting too dry.</li>
            <li>Place rice, 7 ½ cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil and simmer until rice is nearly done yet a little chewy, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain any excess water.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet; add sliced onion and cook until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Layer about ½ of the rice in the bottom of a deep pot with a lid. Spoon the lamb masala mixture over the rice. Spread fried onion over lamb masala. Top with remaining rice.</li>
            <li>Stir saffron and warm milk together in a small bowl; pour over top layer of rice. Cover the pot with the lid and place the pot over low heat; cook until the rice is thoroughly cooked, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
